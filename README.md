Redux **store** it's like our global state for the app.

Redux **reducer** it's like an isolated state of the app.
A good practice to create **reducers** it's to create an initial state and it's interfaces.

To set more than one **reducer** in our **store**, we can create a **rootReducer** and use **combineReducers** method to export them.
